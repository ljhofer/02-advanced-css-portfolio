      <p>
      After teaching elementary school for 11 years, I am looking forward to transitioning into a career in web development. I love to travel and learn about different cultures, explore nature, and sample new foods.  I am an avid reader and enjoy reading many genres. In addition, I am passionate about the ethical treatment of animals. I live in Minnesota with my husband, dog, cat, and two foster chickens.
